    <h1>Touch-a-Neuron: Hebbian-Routed Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Models</h1>

    <div class="abstract">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The computational scalability of contemporary deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, is fundamentally challenged by their characteristically dense parameterization and full activation patterns across layers. While Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ameliorate this by enabling conditional computation—activating only a discrete subset of parameters tailored to each input token—they conventionally rely on gating networks optimized solely through gradient-based methods derived from a global task objective. This paper introduces <strong>"Touch-a-Neuron,"</strong> a novel paradigm for sparse MoE models that integrates biologically inspired Hebbian learning principles directly into the expert routing mechanism. Departing from standard practice, Touch-a-Neuron posits that the synaptic efficacy, or connection strength, between input representations and the selection units controlling expert access should be dynamically modulated by local co-activation statistics. Specifically, it employs a stabilized Hebbian update rule where the pathway associating an input feature pattern with a particular expert is potentiated or depressed based on their correlated activity, embodying the neurobiological principle of "neurons that fire together, wire together" within the routing decision process itself. This activity-dependent plasticity inherently fosters sparsity and promotes the emergence of specialized expert functions based on learned input-expert associations, rather than solely relying on global error signals. We hypothesize that this approach may lead to models exhibiting enhanced adaptability to data statistics, improved computational efficiency through more targeted expert utilization, and potentially greater interpretability of the learned routing logic. This work provides a detailed exposition of the Touch-a-Neuron theoretical framework, its architectural instantiation, the resultant hybrid learning dynamics (combining local Hebbian updates with global backpropagation for experts), and a discussion of its prospective advantages and inherent challenges.

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The sheer computational power harnessed by modern deep neural networks often masks an underlying inefficiency: processing every input through the vast majority of their parameters, regardless of relevance (Brown et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). This dense computational paradigm stands in stark contrast to biological neural systems, which achieve remarkable efficiency through sparse activation and specialized pathways – only relevant neuronal circuits fire intensely for a given task (Olshausen & Field, 1997). Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures (Jacobs et al., 1991; Shazeer et al., 2017) partially bridge this gap by introducing conditional computation: routing each input token to only a small fraction of specialized 'expert' subnetworks. This significantly reduces the operational compute cost (FLOPs per token).
</p>
<p>
    However, the intelligence directing this traffic – the gating network – typically learns its routing policy using the same global, error-driven backpropagation mechanism that trains the experts (Fedus et al., 2021). While effective, this approach raises a question: could routing itself benefit from a more localized, adaptive learning mechanism, mirroring how pathways might form in the brain? Current gating networks learn associations implicitly through the lens of a global objective function, potentially missing finer-grained, input-specific affinities that local learning rules could capture.
</p>
<p>
    Enter Hebbian plasticity, a cornerstone principle of neuroscience (Hebb, 1949). It posits that synaptic connections strengthen when neurons on either side of the synapse are active simultaneously – "neurons that fire together, wire together." This provides a powerful mechanism for learning associations and sculpts neural circuitry based purely on local activity correlations, independent of a global error signal. Could this principle be harnessed not just for feature learning, but for dynamically determining *which* expert should process *which* input?
</p>
<p>
    This paper explores precisely that possibility through the <strong>Touch-a-Neuron</strong> framework. We propose replacing or augmenting the standard MoE gating mechanism with one governed by Hebbian learning. The core hypothesis is that the affinity between an input representation and an expert's gate should strengthen based on their historical co-activation. Essentially, if routing an input <span class="variable">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> to expert <span class="variable">\(E_i\)</span> frequently occurs (the input 'touches' the expert's pathway) and this activation pattern persists, the connection strength between <span class="variable">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>'s features and <span class="variable">\(E_i\)</span>'s gate should increase via a local Hebbian update. This contrasts sharply with adjusting routing weights based solely on how they eventually contribute to reducing the final task loss.
</p>
<p>
    Such a mechanism promises a routing system that is inherently associative and potentially more adaptive to input statistics. It might foster more distinct expert specialization driven by direct input correlations and offer a different pathway towards efficient, dynamically configured computation.

    <h2>2. Related Work</h2>
<p>
    The Touch-a-Neuron framework intersects several key areas of machine learning and computational neuroscience research: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts, routing mechanisms, Hebbian learning, and biologically inspired neural computation.
</p>

<h3>2.1 Sparse Mixture-of-Experts and Routing</h3>
<p>
    The foundational concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) dates back to Jacobs et al. (1991), proposing a divide-and-conquer strategy where different subnetworks ('experts') specialize on different parts of the input space, guided by a gating network. The modern resurgence, particularly in large language models, was catalyzed by Shazeer et al. (2017) who introduced *sparse* MoE layers. In this paradigm, each input token is routed to only a small, fixed number (<span class="variable">k</span>, typically 1 or 2) of experts out of a larger pool (<span class="variable">N</span>), significantly reducing computational cost while allowing model capacity to scale dramatically (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Du et al., 2022).
</p>
<p>
    Crucially, the standard routing mechanism involves a gating network, often a simple linear layer followed by a softmax function, that computes assignment probabilities (or logits) for each expert based on the input representation <span class="variable">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. The top-<span class="variable">k</span> experts with the highest scores are selected. The parameters of this gating network, like those of the experts, are typically trained end-to-end using backpropagation, guided by the overall task loss. A significant challenge in this standard setup is ensuring load balancing across experts to prevent only a few experts from being consistently chosen. This is commonly addressed by introducing auxiliary loss functions that incentivize balanced routing assignments (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020). Other variations include noisy top-<span class="variable">k</span> gating to encourage exploration (Shazeer et al., 2017) or exploring alternative routing schemes like hashing (Roller et al., 2021). However, these approaches predominantly rely on gradient descent derived from global objectives or heuristics for balancing, rather than local, activity-dependent learning rules for association formation.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Hebbian Learning in Neural Networks</h3>
<p>
    Hebbian learning, stemming from Donald Hebb's postulate (1949), provides a biologically plausible mechanism for synaptic plasticity based on local correlations. In its simplest form, the change in synaptic weight <span class="variable">\(\Delta w_{ij}\)</span> between a pre-synaptic neuron <span class="variable">\(j\)</span> and a post-synaptic neuron <span class="variable">\(i\)</span> is proportional to the product of their activations (<span class="variable">\(\Delta w_{ij} \propto x_j y_i\)</span>). This principle underlies various unsupervised learning rules and models, including principal component analysis (Oja's rule, 1982), associative memories (Hopfield, 1982 - although incorporating decay), and self-organizing maps (Kohonen, 1982).
</p>
<p>
    In the context of deep learning, Hebbian-like rules have been explored, often for unsupervised pre-training, regularization, or as components within more complex architectures aiming for biological plausibility (e.g., Krotov & Hopfield, 2016; Pogodin et al., 2021). These efforts typically focus on learning representations within layers or building associative memories. However, the direct application of Hebbian principles to dynamically govern the *routing* decisions in a conditional computation framework like MoE remains largely unexplored. Existing Hebbian methods primarily focus on adjusting weights *within* processing units or layers based on co-activation, not adjusting the *connectivity map* itself on-the-fly for input-dependent pathway selection in the MoE sense.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Biologically Plausible Sparsity and Local Learning</h3>
<p>
    The brain operates with remarkable energy efficiency, partially attributed to sparse coding and activation patterns (Olshausen & Field, 1997; Lennie, 2003). Neurons develop specialized responses, and only a fraction are strongly active for any given stimulus. Computational models aiming for biological plausibility often incorporate local learning rules (like Hebbian variants or Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity - STDP) and mechanisms that promote sparsity, such as lateral inhibition or homeostatic plasticity that regulates firing rates (Foldiak, 1990; Bienenstock et al., 1982).
</p>
<p>
    Touch-a-Neuron draws inspiration from this confluence. While standard MoE achieves *activation* sparsity (only <span class="variable">k</span> experts compute), the proposed Hebbian routing introduces a learning mechanism grounded in local activity correlations, akin to biological synaptic modification. This contrasts with global gradient-based routing optimization, potentially offering a different inductive bias—one favouring specialization based on direct, repeated input-expert co-activation rather than solely on downstream task performance contribution. It attempts to embed a form of associative learning directly into the routing fabric of the network. Our approach differs from purely biologically motivated models by integrating this local rule within a framework where the experts themselves are still trained via efficient backpropagation, aiming for a hybrid model that leverages strengths from both paradigms.
