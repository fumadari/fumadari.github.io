## About Me

Hey! I’m Dario, a Computer Science and Mathematics graduate from Washington and Lee University. Originally from a [small village in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisternino), I’m currently a Prototype Architect at Amazon Web Services in New York City, crafting large-scale AI solutions that harness the cloud to handle massive datasets.

My research interests sit at the intersection of deep learning, mathematics, and geometry. I’m fascinated by how concepts like graph structures, differential geometry, and topological analysis can enhance neural representations, making models more interpretable and robust. By tapping into these mathematical frameworks, I aim to develop techniques that offer clear, principled insights into complex data, pushing AI towards more transparent and flexible solutions.

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities to deepen my understanding of these approaches and apply them to real-world challenges in scalable machine learning and data-driven discovery.

### Presented Work

#### [Selective Replication for Efficient k-NN Retrieval](./projects/vectors-replication.html)
This work proposes a selective vector replication method to boost k-nearest neighbor search performance in high-dimensional spaces. By identifying and replicating only the “boundary” vectors that connect multiple clusters, we significantly improve recall while reducing the number of vectors accessed during queries. The result is a more efficient and accurate large-scale search solution, striking an optimal balance between storage overhead, query speed, and overall retrieval quality.

#### [Hierarchically Partitioned Cloud-Native Vector Search](./projects/s3-index.html)
This research redesigns vector similarity search for cloud environments, leveraging S3’s parallelism and a hierarchical graph partitioning approach. By breaking large HNSW graphs into optimally sized subgraphs and retrieving them in parallel, we achieve lower query latency and maintain high recall at billion-scale. The result is a cloud-native vector index that balances scalable performance, storage efficiency, and search quality.

#### [GeoGAT: Geometry-Enriched Graph Attention for Molecular Insights](./projects/gat-drug-discovery.html)
GeoGAT integrates graph attention networks with geometric and quantum features to enhance molecular property prediction. By incorporating 3D structural descriptors, electronic characteristics, and a global context “supernode,” the model learns to focus on chemically meaningful regions. This approach improves accuracy on tasks like binding affinity and solubility prediction while offering interpretable attention patterns that highlight key functional groups and interactions. The result is a more informed, geometry-aware framework that aligns closely with established chemical principles and provides actionable insights for drug discovery and materials science.
